How do you stay organized and manage your time between various tasks or projects?
  To stay organized and manage my time effectively, I rely on a combination of digital tools and proven methodologies. I actively utilize project management software like JIRA to keep track of tasks and deadlines. It allows me to create structured to-do lists, prioritize tasks, and set achievable deadlines. In my current role at Tata Consultancy Services, I often collaborate with cross-functional teams and participate in Agile sprints. This experience has taught me the importance of maintaining open communication and adapting to changing priorities. I allocate specific time blocks for different projects, ensuring that I dedicate focus to the most critical tasks, such as implementing modern UI components using React and MUI or addressing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) issues. Additionally, I review my progress regularly to adjust my strategy based on what's working and what's not. This approach has significantly improved my productivity, allowing me to meet deadlines and deliver high-quality work consistently, such as reducing frontend load times by 25%.

Can you explain how you implemented the multi-authentication login module at TCS and the technologies used?

  At Tata Consultancy Services, I implemented a multi-authentication login module that offers various login methods including OTP, password, authentication code, and QR code logins. The primary goal was to enhance security while ensuring user convenience, particularly critical in todayâ€™s application environment where cybersecurity threats loom large. We decided on React and JavaScript for the frontend due to their capability to build highly interactive user interfaces. For the backend, I integrated this module with a Node.js environment, which allowed effective communication with our database powered by MongoDB. I started by designing the user interface, focusing on a clean, user-friendly experience with Material UI (MUI). This decision was driven by MUI's flexibility in creating responsive layouts. The process involved creating separate login screens for each method while ensuring users could navigate seamlessly between them. We also integrated libraries that supported QR code generation and validation processes. On the security side, I implemented protocols to handle OTP generation and validation, ensuring that these were sent securely to user devices. To validate user inputs, I relied on a combination of client-side validation through React and server-side validation using Express. One of the major challenges was not only to integrate these various login methods but also to ensure that they operated cohesively. Hence, I maintained continuous communication with the backend team to ensure API endpoints were functional and efficient. The result was a decrease in user login-related incidents, along with improved overall application security. The system not only met the project requirements but also received positive feedback from users for its ease of use.



How do you ensure your React components are optimized for performance and accessibility?



 Performance Optimization:

Memoization:
Use React.memo() to avoid unnecessary re-renders for functional components.
Use useMemo() and useCallback() to cache values/functions across renders.
Code Splitting:
Use React.lazy and Suspense to lazy-load components only when needed.
Avoid Anonymous Functions in JSX:
Declare functions outside of render to prevent new function instances on every render.
Efficient State Management:
Lift state only when needed.
Split large components into smaller ones to isolate re-renders.
Virtualization:
Use libraries like react-window or react-virtualized for large lists to render only what's visible.
